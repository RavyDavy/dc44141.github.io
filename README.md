## Welcome to DC44141

We are the Glasgow Defcon Chapter, and you are very welcome.

We meet on the **first Tuesday** of every month at the Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) Student's Association building. The following map shows which building that is in relation to Cowcaddens Road:

**If you would like to speak as well then you absolutely can. Ask [@dc44141](https://twitter.com/dc44141). We also accept unannounced talks where you just get up without fanfare and have had a few do it that way in the heat of the moment.**

## Ethos 

DC44141 is free. It is free to attend. It is free to talk at. It is free of commercial sponsorship. 

It is welcoming. The only thing NOT tolerated is intolerance, if you see something say something.

## Organisers

It is run by volunteers on a happily chaotic basis. To my knowledge there has never been a committee meeting or anything. These reprobates are generally involved though:

* [@ZephrFish](https://twitter.com/ZephrFish) - Mostly been the face for years if we are honest.
* [@PMason00](https://twitter.com/PMason00) & [@Rab_Ray](https://twitter.com/Rab_Ray) - Also founding fathers along with ZephrFish.
* [@cornerpirate](https://twitter.com/cornerpirate) - regular content provider, failing upwards to a bit of organising in 2020 since nobody cared to stop me.
* [@GCUHacking](https://twitter.com/GCUHacking) - the GCU hacking society who amazingly stepped up to host the event. You legends.

-- note to the editor. If I missed anyone then sorry, my excuse is I wasn't around when DC44141 sparked into existence. 

If this page does not answer your questions (and please check the FAQ below first) then feel free to ask the hive mind! The best way to communicate with us is to use Twitter.

Also PLEASE help us? We don't know what we are doing. If you want to help you definitely can!

## FAQs 

### Is there any food or drink?

The event is entirely free and is not sponsored so there is no food or drink provided. 

The venue has a menu. We will work on adding a photo of it as a brief Google did not turn it up online :D

### That is a university building, I am not a student, can I attend?

Yes. Yes you can. The union building does not require an NUS card or anything to get in. If anyone questions you mumble "Glasgow Defcon" and try to look awkward and you'll get passed on inside. 

### Is the building accessible?

According to the GCU website the entire campus is wheelchair accessible. I appreciate you might laugh and say "folks always say that and it is big fat lies". To my eyes the building can be approached by a ramp, the door has a level floor for entry, and the event is on the ground floor. 

Stay tuned as we will go on to make a video showing exactly what to expect from getting to the venue in the near future.
